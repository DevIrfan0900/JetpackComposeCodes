# RecyclerView in Jetpack Compose with LazyColumn and LazyRow

This project demonstrates how to implement RecyclerView in Jetpack Compose using `LazyColumn` and `LazyRow` composables to display a list of items. The project focuses on the efficient rendering of vertical and horizontal lists, leveraging Jetpack Composeâ€™s declarative UI approach.

## Features
- **LazyColumn**: Used to display a vertically scrolling list of items, rendering only the visible items to optimize performance.
- **LazyRow**: Used to create a horizontally scrolling list of items, similarly optimizing performance for large datasets.
- **Dynamic Data**: The lists are populated with dynamic data that can easily be modified or expanded.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DevIrfan0900/RecyclerviewJetpackCompose
